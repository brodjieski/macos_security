title: Audit Record Reduction and Report Generation
discussion: "The system _IS_ configured with the ability provide and implement an\
  \ audit record reduction and report generation capability. \n\nAudit record reduction\
  \ is a process that manipulates collected audit log information and organizes it\
  \ into a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit record reduction\
  \ and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same system\
  \ or from the same organizational entities that conduct audit logging activities.\
  \ The audit record reduction capability includes modern data mining techniques with\
  \ advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report\
  \ generation capability provided by the system can generate customizable reports.\
  \ Time ordering of audit records can be an issue if the granularity of the timestamp\
  \ in the record is insufficient.\n\nAudit record reduction and report generation\
  \ can be done with tools built into macOS such as auditreduce and praudit. These\
  \ tools are protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP).\n"
