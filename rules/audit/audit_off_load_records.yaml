title: Off-Load Audit Records
discussion: "Audit records should be off-loaded onto a different system or media from\
  \ the system being audited.\n\nInformation stored in only one location is vulnerable\
  \ to accidental or incidental deletion or alteration. Off-loading is a common process\
  \ in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. \n\nTo secure audit\
  \ records by off-loading, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level\
  \ auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed this requirement. \n"
check: |
  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
