title: Prevent the Use of Dictionary Words for Passwords
discussion: "The macOS should be configured to forbid users to use dictionary words\
  \ for passwords. \n\nIf the operating system allows users to select passwords based\
  \ on dictionary words, this increases the window of opportunity for a malicious\
  \ user to guess the password. \n\nTo prevent users from using dictionary words for\
  \ passwords, many operating systems can be integrated with an enterprise-level directory\
  \ service that meets or exceeds this requirement.\n"
check: |
  For systems not requiring mandatory smart card authentication or those that are not bound to a directory, the technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
