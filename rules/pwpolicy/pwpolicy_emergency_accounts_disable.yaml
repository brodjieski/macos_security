title: Automatically Remove or Disable Emergency Accounts within 72 Hours
discussion: "The macOS is able to be configured to automatically remove or disable\
  \ emergency accounts within 72 hours or less. \n\nEmergency administrator accounts\
  \ are privileged accounts established in response to crisis situations where the\
  \ need for rapid account activation is required. Therefore, emergency account activation\
  \ may bypass normal account authorization processes. If these accounts are disabled,\
  \ system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely affecting\
  \ system availability.\n\nAlthough the ability to create and use emergency administrator\
  \ accounts is necessary for performing system maintenance during emergencies, these\
  \ accounts present vulnerabilities to the system if they are not disabled and removed\
  \ when they are no longer needed. Configuring the macOS to automatically remove\
  \ or disable emergency accounts within 72 hours of creation mitigates the risks\
  \ posed if one were to be created and accidentally left active once the crisis is\
  \ resolved. \n\nEmergency administrator accounts are different from infrequently\
  \ used accounts (i.e., local logon accounts used by system administrators when network\
  \ or normal logon is not available). Infrequently used accounts also remain available\
  \ and are not subject to automatic termination dates. However, an emergency administrator\
  \ account is normally a different account created for use by vendors or system maintainers.\n\
  \nTo address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with\
  \ enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed access control\
  \ policy requirements.\n"

  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
