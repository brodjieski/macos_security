title: Configure the System to Notify upon Baseline Configuration Changes
discussion: "The macOS should be configured to automatically notify system administrators,\
  \ Information System Security Officers (ISSOs), and (IMOs) when baseline configurations\
  \ are modified.\n\nUnauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make\
  \ the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating\
  \ system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects,\
  \ some of which may  present security threats. Detecting such changes and providing\
  \ an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could\
  \ ultimately affect the state of the operating system. \n\nTo enable notifications\
  \ and audit logging of changes made to baseline configurations, many operating systems\
  \ can be integrated with enterprise-level auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed\
  \ this requirement. \n"
check: |
  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
