title: Configure the System to Prevent the Unauthorized Disclosure of Data via Shared
  Resources
discussion: "The information system _IS_ configured to ensure that the unauthorized\
  \ disclosure of data does not occur when resources are shared. \n\nThe inherent\
  \ configuration of the macOS does not allow for resources to be shared between users\
  \ without authorization. \n\nlink:https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AuthenticationAndAuthorizationGuide/Permissions/Permissions.html[]\n"
