title: Configure the System to Implement Approved Cryptography to Protect Information
discussion: $OS_VALUE
check: |
  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement using FIPS Validated Cryptographic Modules.
fix: |
  The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
