title: Configure the System to Implement Approved Cryptography to Protect Information
discussion: "The information system _IS_ configured to implement approved cryptography\
  \ to protect information. \n\nUse of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines\
  \ the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The operating system must\
  \ implement cryptographic modules that adhere to the higher standards that have\
  \ been tested, validated, and approved by the federal government. \n\nmacOS Big\
  \ Sur has been submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\
  \ and is in review for the cryptographic module for FIPS 140-3 validation.\n\nlink:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List[]\n\

check: |
  The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement using FIPS Validated Cryptographic Modules.
fix: |
  The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
