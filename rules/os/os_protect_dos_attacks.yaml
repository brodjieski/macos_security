title: Protect Against Denial of Service Attacks by Ensuring Rate-Limiting Measures
  on Network Interfaces
discussion: "The macOS should be configured to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks\
  \ by enforcing rate-limiting measures on network interfaces. \n\nDoS attacks leave\
  \ authorized users unable to access information systems, devices, or other network\
  \ resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. When this occurs,\
  \ the organization must operate at degraded capacity; often resulting in an inability\
  \ to accomplish its mission. \n\nTo prevent DoS attacks by ensuring rate-limiting\
  \ measures on network interfaces, many operating systems can be integrated with\
  \ enterprise-level firewalls and networking equipment that meet or exceed this requirement.\n"
check: |
  The technology does not support this requirement. This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
fix: |
  This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
