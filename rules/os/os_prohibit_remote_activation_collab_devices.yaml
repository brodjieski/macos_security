  The technology partially supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be in full compliance.
fix: |
  The technology partially meets this requirement. An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented for full compliance.

        The inherent configuration of the macOS _IS_ in compliance.

        Apple has implemented a green light physically next to your camera that will glow when the camera is activated. There is an orange dot indicator by the Control Center pull down menu item to indicate when the system's microphone is listening or activated.

        The macOS has built into the system, the ability to grant or deny access to the camera and microphone which requires the application to have an entitlement to use the device.
