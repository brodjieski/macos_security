title: Configure System to Fail to a Known Safe State if System Initialization, Shutdown, or Abort Fails
discussion: "The information system _IS_ configured to fail to a known safe state in the event of a failed system initialization, shutdown, or abort. \n\nFailure to a known safe state helps prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause loss of data or unauthorized access to system resources. \n\nApple File System (APFS) is the default file system for Mac computers using macOS 10.13 and all later versions. APFS includes native encryption, safe document saves, stable snapshots, and crash protection; these features ensure that the macOS fails to safe state. \n\nlink:https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/715/[]\n"
