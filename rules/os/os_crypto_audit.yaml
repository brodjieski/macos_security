title: Protect Audit Integrity with Cryptographic Mechanisms
discussion: "The information system _IS_ configured to implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit information and audit tools. \n\nThe Apple T2 Security Chip includes a dedicated Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) crypto engine built into the direct memory access (DMA) path between the flash storage and main system memory, which powers line-speed encrypted storage with FileVault and makes internal volume highly efficient. \n\nlink:https://www.apple.com/euro/mac/shared/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf[]\n\nNOTE: This will only apply to a Mac that includes a T2 security chip. \n"
