title: The macOS system must uniquely identify peripherals before establishing a connection.
discussion: |-
  Without identifying devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity.

  Peripherals include, but are not limited to, such devices as flash drives, external storage, and printers.

  NOTE: The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance. The technology inherently meets this requirement.
